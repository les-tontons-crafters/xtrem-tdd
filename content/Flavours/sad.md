# Software Architecture Document
## Description
A `SAD` is a general purpose document that write down the intended architecture of the software in development. 

Goes from a high level detail to a low level ADR list associated with the software. 
It uses text description and a wide range of visual tools like diagrams, pictures, UML and others to express and communicate the underlying architecture.

## Why?
A SAD is a very important and helpful knowledge base for a Software development team. 
It provides insight about how the system is made, how:
- it works
- its interfaces
- its components 
and all the decisions that were made during its development.

All this knowledge is useful to communicate the architecture, improve, review and fix it.

## Problems
    - How can I document the Architecture of a Software?
    - How could we explain important aspects of the software that needs explanation?
    - How could we ensure quality of the Software by avoid obscureness of functionality?

## How to
Start by using the simplest tool available, to document the Architecture of the Software. 

**Examples**:
 - Gitlab Wiki: allow diagram-as-code embedded into Markdown
 - Github: allow diagram-as-code embedded into Markdown
 - Plain Markdown

For simplicity, `Markdown` is very useful and generally available. 

Create a Wiki inside the Software repository (or separated if needed).

For Diagrams, use the best fit for you and your team, the main intent being understand and clear communication. [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) is a reasonable good tool for `diagraming as code` in Markdown.

## Template
```markdown    
 - Title
 - Introduction
 - Scope 
 - Driving Requirements / Non Functional Requirements / Main Features
 - Views
   - High level Architecture
   - Components view
   - Modules View
   - API specification
   - Integration / Deployment View
   - Other if Needed
 - ADR(s)
 - References / Additional Bibliography
```    
## Constraint
- Start as soon as possible. 
- Always is best to start now. 
- Work on the SAD in a iterative and incremental manner.
- Always update the SAD when a change is made.

> Keep it Simple: avoid long text descriptions, make visual explanation instead.
